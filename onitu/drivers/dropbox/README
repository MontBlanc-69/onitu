Getting started with the Dropbox driver
=======================================

Run the get_access_token.py script in order to let Onitu gain access to your
Dropbox account.

Retrieve the access key and secret provided by the script and put it in
Onitu's setup.json for Onitu to use it to authenticate itself with the Dropbox Core API.
